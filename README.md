# SpaceApp
This is a website I created a couple of years ago while I was studying Visual Studio .Net C#. 
It's a slide show of pictures of the main planets of our system copied from Nasa's image website.
I put on a timer on each page to make it cycle through 5 pictures and then stops.
This is not a live website. It's just something I created for practice.
